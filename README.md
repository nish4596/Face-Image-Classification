# Face-Image-Classification
In this project, I have used the olivetti faces dataset from kaggle and created various models to classify the images. This data consists of 40 labels and each label has 10 different images which makes a total of 400 images. Each 
PROJECT OBJECTIVE
The Objective of the project is to train an image classifier which can recognize facial data and accurately classify the person into their given class. I have used the olivetti faces dataset from kaggle and created various models to classify the images. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE DATASET
• The dataset consists of images of faces of 40 distinct people taken from April 1992 to April 1994.
• There are 10 different images for a single person which accumulates to a total of 400 images in the dataset.
• All these images are of grayscale, with a black background and of size 64*64.
• The data retrieved is already preprocessed by the publisher and there is also no missing data within the dataset, the pixel of the images is scaled to an interval of [0,1].
• The target variable is set as 40 distinct integers from 0 to 39. Each person has one of the 40 integers as their label.
